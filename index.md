## DOWNLOAD THE PP COUNTER HERE!

So, uh, you've probably noticed that this isn't the site that's shown in my tutorial video....
Well, that's because that guy didn't update it anymore. So, temporarily, I will be taking over with the updated compiled version of Sync.

### ADVANCED VERSION:

Simply download it, extract, and run Sync.
[Jeric's_Sync_Collection0913.rar](https://github.com/jericjan/jeric-osu-sync/releases/download/9%2F13/Jeric.s_Sync_Collection0913.rar).

Oh, and you gotta do this for some reason. Windows doesn't trust it, but I assure you it's safe.

Then, you can also unblock it in the properties before extracting to make sure it runs properly.
